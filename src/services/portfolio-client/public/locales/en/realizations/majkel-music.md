The `Majkel Music` project is the website of the local disco polo star. On the website you can find the latest news about Micha≈Ç's activities, his work, divided into three categories: songs, albums and music videos as well as a concert tour and contact information.

All songs and albums can be listened to using the built-in responsive music player.

Editing content on the website is extremely simple, thanks to the CMS system tailored exactly to the project requirements. Thanks to this, the content management system does not contain many unnecessary options, which significantly simplifies its use for people who are not familiar with this type of systems.

The entire website is fully responsive, both the CMS and the website client are adapted to desktop and mobile devices.

The whole thing is very fast and efficient thanks to the use of the `.NET CORE 1.1` framework. The `PostgreSQL` database is responsible for data storage and the `Entity Framework Core` library with the `Npgsql` as database driver. The frontend of the application is rendered with the `Razor` engine, styles are written with `Sass`. Application scripts and styles have been compiled and compressed using the `Gulp.js` technology.
